# Human-Centred Evaluation of Text-to-Image Generation Models for Self-expression of Mental Distress: A Dataset Based on GPT-4o  

---

## 🪐 Overview  
This repository contains the dataset introduced in the paper:  

> **Human-Centred Evaluation of Text-to-Image Generation Models for Self-expression of Mental Distress: A Dataset Based on GPT-4o**  
> (Submitted to LREC 2026)

The dataset explores how **AI-generated images** can enhance the **self-expression of mental distress** among international students. It contains **authentic textual descriptions**, **AI-generated images**, and **human evaluation scores** assessing their helpfulness in facilitating their self-expression of mental distress.  

This is the **first publicly available text-to-image dataset** with human evaluation scores in the **mental health domain**, offering a valuable multimodal benchmark for both language and vision researchers.

## 📂 Dataset Contents  

| Component | Description | Quantity |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Textual Descriptions** | 100 sentences describing participants’ experiences of mental distress, extracted from interview transcripts. | 100 |
| **Generated Images** | Images generated using GPT-4o from four persona-based prompt templates (Basic, Illustrator, Photographer, Creative Artist). | 400 (4 per description) |
| **Evaluation Scores** | Human evaluation scores indicating how helpful each image was for self-expression (0 = not helpful, 2 = slightly helpful, 4 = helpful, 6 = very helpful). | 400 |
| **Metadata** | Includes participant ID (anonymised), prompt type, and best-image selections. | — |

## 🧪 Data Collection and Methodology  

The dataset was created through a **three-stage experimental design**:  

1. **Stage 1 – Mental Distress Description**  
   - 20 Chinese international students at UK universities were interviewed about their experiences of mental distress.  
   - Five short descriptions about their mental distress were extracted from the interview transcripts, resulting in 100 short textual inputs. 

2. **Stage 2 – Image Generation**  
   - Descriptions were elaborated using **GPT-4o** with four **persona-based prompt templates**: *basic*, *illustrator*, *photographer*, and *creative artist*.  
   - GPT-4o then generated images (1024 × 1024 px) from each elaboration. 

3. **Stage 3 – Human Evaluation**  
   - Participants rated each image on a categorical scale (0, 2, 4, 6) according to its helpfulness for self-expression.  
   - They also selected the “best image” for each description.  
   - Automatic BLIP2 similarity scores were computed as a quantitative complement.

## 📊 Key Findings 

- **Prompt design matters:** Images generated by GPT-4o did improve the self-expression of mental distress for international students. The *illustrator* persona achieved the highest mean helpfulness score, followed by *basic*, *creative artist*, and *photographer*.   
- **Dataset significance:** Provides the first benchmark combining human-generated emotional descriptions, AI-generated images, and human evaluation scores in the mental-health domain.

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations  

- All participants provided informed consent under approved university ethics protocols.  
- Descriptions were anonymised and reviewed to remove personally identifiable information.  
- Images may depict abstract or emotional states but **do not represent real individuals**.
